[Live Site](https://youknowhu.github.io/Pac-Man/)

The player navigates Pac-Man through a maze to collect dots while avoiding colorful ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde). The player wins a level if they successfully collect all the dots. There are special dots called "power pellets" that give Pac-Man the temporary ability to eat the ghosts.
